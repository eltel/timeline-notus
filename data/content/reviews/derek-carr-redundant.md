**Deltamaxx / O-En-One is a new project from our man in Westmeath, Derek Carr master of deep and emotive techno. With influences from pioneers such as B12, the Black Dog, Likemind, Stasis and As One Derek has, over the last 20 years, continued to craft his own unique sound that more than stands the test of time..**

**_Following on from his essential 2019 compilation - A Future-Retrospective of Art on For Those That Know and 2021 album Arrival on Steve Rutter’s FireScope, Derek serves us up with 8 tracks of flawless electronics on his own Trident Recordings label._**

Each track on this album is a lovely odyssey into warm and intelligent music. Skittering percussion, evolving pads and insistent melodies make this an absolute delight to listen to on these cold and wet November evenings.

This is engaging and emotive music that is firmly aimed at heads but also feet; the kick drum anchors and drives the music - ensuring that this album will find its way into lot of DJ’s sets and bring a lot of joyful moments to clubs and festivals.

**_The standout track for me is Yirelia which is just lovely, and IMHO nails this type of music flawlessly. Think Derek May’s Icon or John Beltran’s Moths and you’ll get the quality and essence of this. Nice one Derek.._**

Highly recommended.
