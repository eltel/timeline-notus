**_James Ruskin’s enigmatic ‘Blueprint’ label returns for its second EP of the year, with a debut from Portuguese rhythmic maestro, Temudo._**

**Having released top-notch EPs already on labels such as Soma, Klockworks & his own imprint Hayes, the Lisbon native does not disappoint with his latest offering.**

**_Available on both vinyl & digital formats the EP features 4 tracks of his trademark peak time cuts. _**

‘You Spelled Corn Wrong’ opens the EP with a driving, rhythmic feel which almost feels like a modern take on Jeff Mills’ Purpose Maker Project.

Next up ‘The Neuro Funk’ is a more hypnotic affair with a bleepy synth line and a tasty hi-hat and certainly something to stomp your feet and lose yourself to.

The flip side of the EP begins with ‘Lea Blanche’ a real builder, that takes the temperature to boiling point and gets you fully immersed in its hardgroove vibe

‘P is for Paula’ finishes off the EP with a deeper, more stripped-back cut which is powerful in its simplicity. This one is dark & futuristic and the perfect way to sign off the release.

**Moraliste is released on both formats on 3rd March.**
