**Curated by Luther Vine(Phonica Records) 'Fragments of Reality’ is a brand-new label from the people who brought you the now infamous 20/20 Vision. With a focus on, how can I put this?... More lysergic flavours of house and techno, I have to say, this first volume definitely hit the mark for this reviewer.**

Voigtmann, who is founder of the label Subsequent, which has released more than its fair share of ground-breaking tracks in recent years, drops ‘Automatic Chemistry’, riddled with hip-swinging, pelvis gyrating acidic bass and some lovely, moist, wet flourishes and old-school, main room hooks. Prime time business.

‘Receptivity’, from Priori out of Montreal has a more cerebral air to it, sweeping pads and percussive basslines perch perfectly atop a wonky, somewhat clunky house beat – but the combination is sublime, the smoothness of the dreamy, spaced-out lead-synths atop this off-kilter percussion and intermittent marimba riffs provide some late night, heads down – brains up vibes. This is big and you are guaranteed to hear this out – if ‘out’ is still permitted by the pandemic where you are. If it isn’t, this works equally as well for home-listening, deep and yet eminently danceable.

Over on the flipside, Rotterdam outfit D&S drop ‘Expulsion’, a shimmering, beauty of a track, layered, structured pads and strings give this number its depth, and the dope drum programming provides the drive. The connection between the Detroit and the Dutch techno sounds has long been known, and is clearly evident here, profoundly resonant music for the madrugada.

Rupert Marnie finishes things off admirably with ‘Drifter’. Monstrously big sawtooth hooks and some vibrantly stabby leads, underpinned by some ever-swelling pads intertwine over some powerful percussion to provide this quality four-tracker with its perfect end point.

Four out of four here guys, out on vinyl and digital formats later this week, one not to be missed!
