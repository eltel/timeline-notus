**Fresh from the release by Barce, the Macedonian label Logos Recordings returns with an absolute stunner of an album, entitled "Celestial Connections". The label, run by Samoil Radinski, has been around for the best part of 15 years, and has provided a steady supply of quality music over that period from both new and already acclaimed artists, including Gary Martin, D Knox, Mihail P, Niko Marks and Alex Agore.**

**_This latest release is from the former camp, a relative newcomer, fellow Macedonian, Bo. I tried to have a look around and find out more about the (to me at least) mysterious Bo, but alas I couldn't. It doesn't really matter though, because, with Celestial Connections, his music really does the talking._**

Some albums will have a couple of filler tracks mixed in, but not with this release.
From the moody and melancholic opening "Future Wonders", to the second track "Grade Analasys" resplendent with beautiful pads and soaring strings, this is the type of hi-tech jazz UR referred to. There are also a number of electro tracks including "Feel" and "Cignal", which may, or may not, be a nod to Cignol, is a lovely slice of radiant electro.

This is a nice contrast to a track like the deeply brooding "The Tide Moves" and the downtempo 303 beast, "Acid Breaks n Acid Lakes". "Skuba" harks back to late 90s Octave One, and "Planet Void 1" rounds off the original tracks nicely, with a sci-fi shout-out to the celestial bodies in the night sky.

The album also features two remixes.
The first is from Mihail P, whose music just keeps getting better and better and has already released music on Distant Worlds, Verdant and Ferox. Mihail takes the 303-dominated original and turns it into a thing of sublime beauty. Appropriately named the "Dream Remix", Mihail's mysterious deep pads and glimmering melodies channel all the right moves for a blissful trip past a celestial giant. Denny Trakkov, one half of Mosaik Kollektif, rounds off the all-Macedonian affair with his remix of "Planet Void" and turns this into a dark slice of electro. A fitting end to a complete and well-rounded album.

**_It's hard to pick a favourite track on this release and such is the quality of each track, you could be forgiven for thinking this album had been created by a seasoned pro. Bo has clearly pulled on a range of influences and inspirations, yet has sprinkled his own class onto these intergalactic lullabies dripping in ambient techno soul. Fans of Cignol, Tim Jackiw and basically any quality electronic music will love this release as much as I do._**

Highly recommended.
