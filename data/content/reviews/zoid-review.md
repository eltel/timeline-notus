**Metamorphic returns with a four track release by Irish artist ZOiD that features two original pieces by him and remixes of each by label boss Dan Curtin and John Tejada. Billed as Hi-Tek jazz this has all the potential of being something quite special.**

**_Opening the release is title track of sorts, ‘Space station dexaphonic’ in its original form is full of sophistication, charm, and deep rhythms. Very much in keeping with the sort of otherworldly techno Dan Curtin is known for this has the vibe of something that would provide the soundtrack for interstellar travel as you glide across the cosmos. Quite simply the synth work here is gorgeous._**

The remix is provided by a certain John Tejada, another excellent provider of all things deftly produced. This is no exception as he keeps the original tracks feel intact whilst enhancing it with some tough yet understated work on the bassline. More Hi-Tek jazz for your aural delight.

On the flip ‘Poochy’ lifts the tempo slightly with a more urgent groove, heavy beats and more of that other-worldly work on the synths. This one relentlessly makes you move your body and is pure dancefloor fire. Some seriously choice percussion that again is suitably fresh to my ears and we have another winner on this stellar release.

**_Finally, Dan Curtin steps up on remix duties to close out the release. And, as you might expect we have another orgy of sound. This still has equal emphasis on the percussion on deep, esoteric chords. What can only be described as Hi-Tek jazz at its finest, Techno and electronic music at its finest._**

rom the outset this promised to be something special and unsurprisingly it does not disappoint at all. If you like your electronic music full of soul, warmth, and depth with a truly forward feel then this is for you.
