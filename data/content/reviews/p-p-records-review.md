**Fresh from his nearly 20 min appearance on the ambient masterpiece v/a "Less Popular Than Cats" on Verdant Recordings, Liverpool's Reedale Rise and Lost Control 2097 Records owner, Black Eyes, who released the Ecstasy EP in early November, have joined forces as Planet People, with their goal of "saving the planet from itself'..**

**_Sharing a deep love for Chicago & New York House, Planet People hit it out of the park with this release. I've been a huge fan of Reedale Rise since watching his videos on Youtube and his first release on Common Dreams back in 2015, so I couldn't wait to listen to this. The first track "Hyper Glidin" has Mr Rise's signature deep, beautiful pads in all their glory. "Portal Funk" up next is a pumping groover of a track, perfect for a peak-time dancefloor!_**

"Reaktor Theory" on the flip is quite reminiscent of the 90's New York House both these producers love, with typical bumping bassline continuing the dancefloor havoc the previous track started. Rounding out the release is "Subsurface Nature" that sounds like a Model 500 & Master Reese track brought forward to 2022, with it's deep base and subterranean textures resplendent throughout.
