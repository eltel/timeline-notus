**Electronic music royalty and Detroit native, Keith Tucker (Aux 88, Frequency, K-1, AlienFM, Direct Beat and Puzzlebox Records founder) serves up another powerful selection of cinematic soulful music under his Optic Nerve moniker; 3 albums 24 singles and counting since 1995!
**

**_As with all of Keith’s music, this latest EP is in no way formulaic or derivative; the soul, funk, and positive energy comes through loud and clear. To my ears, there’s something about Keith’s music that just sounds…better than many contemporary releases. Having obsessively collected all of Keith’s music for the last 30 + years and seen videos of his studio and read numerous interviews with him it’s clear to me why this music is of such high quality. Keith Tucker is a serious musician who continues to put the hard work in and draws from deep deep roots, making zero compromises on sound design or production or current trends. The impact of this is tangible, you can hear and feel it, and as Geraldine Hunt said, “Can’t Fake the Feeling._**

For me the Linear Motion EP is four separate stories of forward motion in time and space, each track looks and sounds firmly future-focused, with themes and motifs from science fiction and space travel, all designed to uplift and engage any dance floor with maximum impact.

Each one of the four tracks on this EP is superb, but honourable mentions must go out for the track “Echoes” which is a peak time floor filler, with a pounding 4x4 beat enriched with subtle synth stabs that grow and develop, minimal hi-hats, driving percussion- stripped back, but with so much depth and power and finally a bassline weaving in and out of the track like a cybernetic Bootsy Collins riff building on and driving the groove.

However, my favourite track is “Sequence in Time“. I love the fusion of arps, muted claps, skittering percussion and a direct and positive funky yet minimal baseline that creates a beautiful odyssey in techno soul from the source; and when the strings come in, they make every hair on my body stand on edge, and that’s just on my speakers at home! This track played through a big club or festival rig will be immense! Music like this is a real joy to hear and play out as it brings well needed joy to the listeners and dance floor!

**_Thank you again to Keith Tucker for remaining true to the spirit of this music, which he’s been championing and progressing since the mid-80s._**

Highly recommended. This is out now as a limited edition on white vinyl then fully released on 21/10/22. Buy This EP.
