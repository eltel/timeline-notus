## Following on from the excellent Sonicus Croniclus eps, the 10th release on Keith Tenniswood’s Asking for Trouble label continues his mission of delivering high-quality and original, electronic music.

**For this release, Phil Klein, AKA Bass Junkie does what he’s been consistently doing for the last 30 years and serves us up an EP of slamming hi-tempo electro.**

**_With an EP this strong, it’s hard to pick a favourite, but my current favourite track is Bubble Funk which bounces and jacks in fine style. Tight baselines, sci-fi samples, jacking beats with wicked TR808 zaps, clever synth leads and pads, all melded together to make a guaranteed dance floor filler._**

And if that’s not enough, Radioactive Man then turns in a superb remix of this track. Carefully deconstructing the original and taking it deeper and darker, more brooding, and relentless, and to my ears more dubby, while keeping the original flavour.

**Available as a digital download or on vinyl in my favourite 10” format this is a must-buy and will be bouncing heads and feet for some time. Love it.**
