**If driving, pumping, percussive techno is your bag, you're definitely not going to be disappointed with Alexander Johansson and Mattias Fridell's release on James Ruskin's Blueprint Records.**

**_Having already released over 70 odd records combined, the Swedish duo's credentials of hard-hitting, yet funky records are well and truly solidified in the techno community._**

Kicking off the 'Geometriska Strukturer EP', the first track 'Cylindrar' wastes no time in getting straight to the point, and letting you know you are in for one hell of a ride, with its jacking rhythms, and driving hi-hat patterns.

'Liksidig' continues in the same vein, with the pumping kick drum leading the way. Over halfway through the track, a subtle stab elevates the track and gets that head of yours nodding away.

Over on the b-side, 'Klot' doesn't let up with the frenzied, yet funky rhythms. Featuring a short vocal, the track really comes into its own when the clap kicks in just before the halfway mark.

Koner finishes off this release nicely, with more of the same, and the sudden ending seems appropriate given the ferocious nature of each track.

Solid, funky, and beautifully crafted, the tracks feature enough subtle elements to keep the most discerning of techno fiends entertained, whether in the club, or dimming the lights, cranking up the volume, and letting this great release do its job.

**This is a great start to 2023 for both the artists and the label. As Alexander & Mattias say "Sly & shifty, you may rely on us...", and we can certainly rely on them for tough, funky and pulsating techno!**

##### Do yourself a favour, grab this when you can. Out on both digital and vinyl on Jan 27.
