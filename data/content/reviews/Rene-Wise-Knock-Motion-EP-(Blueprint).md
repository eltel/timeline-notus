**Well, having released previously on such serious labels as Rødhåd's WSNWG, Luke Slater's Mote-Evolver and Mark Broom’s Beardman I’m more than a little embarrassed to say that the name Rene Wise is new to me, and more embarrassed still after listening to this, his latest release, due out on yet another super-serious label, James Ruskin’s iconic Blueprint.**

This, whilst clearly sitting in the techno field, is an undoubtedly fresh, decidedly adult take on the genre. Deeply melancholic, wistful touches integrate beautifully with abrasive, brutal effects and synth-work to devastating effect. Both moving and engaging, super-eerie in places, and yet eminently driving, dancefloor devastating material. This is profoundly moving in both the physical sense, and also in the deeply introverted emotional sense.

**The percussion on here is worth noting for its progression, drive and detail, this is not surprising due to Rene’s background in drums, his father, a professional drummer was a guiding light in Rene’s evolution in music.**

This is tough as you like, hard edged techno with layers of profundity causing the listener to simultaneously navel gaze (in the best possible way!) and dance hard! Flawless production and an inherent sense of purpose fuel the compositions on offer here – comparisons are pointless with elements of DBX, vintage Neil Landstrumm and Luke Slater himself – but an unmistakable air of originality that’s all Rene Wise.

I definitely won’t be missing any of his releases in future - this is not _‘recommended’_, this is **essential!**

This is due out on both vinyl and digital formats this week.
