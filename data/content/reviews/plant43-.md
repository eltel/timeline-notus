**Please note that I must caveat this review with a warning that I'm a massive fan of all things Plant43, so this will be heavily biased!**

**_Emile Facey started releasing music as Plant43 in 2005, and over the last 18 years, has established himself as a force to be reckoned with in electronic music. Numerous releases on Ai, Frustrated Funk, AC Records, Shipwrec, Eudemonia, SCSI, CPU, Semantica, Future Massive and now his own Plant43 Recordings, all demonstrate his versatility as a producer and his unique sound and style._**

From shimmering melodic electronics that build and hold tension on the dance floor, to ambient projects, such as the Vaulted Arches, The Countless Stones and From Deep Streams that are meditative and designed for deep listening and appreciation. In fact, if you like your ambient music do try to go to one of Emile's Bleep43 horizontals to hear his ambient projects live. Bleep43 events are typically run a couple of times a year and there's one in December in London.

Anyway, the Remote Signals EP is classic Plant43. The opening track has a no-nonsense driving rhythm, and futuristic lead melodies, accentuated by pads playing with the harmonic structure and portamentos and percussion using a call-and-response intertwining to build positive, engaging, and uplifting electro.

Searching the Skies is basically a science fiction soundtrack on the hunt for a movie, it is a seriously evocative piece of music. Building from a simple kick and snare, adding high-intensity hi-hats and LFO-modulated, arpeggiated leads; it grows to make a complete, emotional soundscape.

Constantly Morphing has an electro zap and jacking beat combined with more of a focus on minor chords that make this the perfect last track on the EP, direct yet tinged with melancholy. Hi-tech electronics from the source.

In summary, Remote Signals is the ninth release on Plant43 Records and an instant classic. The label (and artist) goes from strength to strength; so, if you're a fan buy it quickly - these releases do sell out quickly.

**_I'm looking forward to getting my copy of this on vinyl and can't wait to vibrate sound systems with it!_**

Highly Recommended.
