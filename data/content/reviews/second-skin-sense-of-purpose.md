**The Spanish techno contingent of Oscar Mulero and Psyk team up as Second Skin for James Ruskin’s infamous Blueprint label. Blueprint themselves have been on quite a roll with their output of late, and we, at Timeline Music, are here for it every step of the way.**

Techno afficionados will already be familiar with both Oscar Mulero and Psyk’s previous output. Oscar’s been killing it on his Warm Up and PoleGroup Records since early this century as well as putting out some proper heads down/hands up techno for the likes of Token and Semantica Records. Psyk, on the other hand has the excellent Non Series label as well as multiple releases for the likes of Luke Slater’s Mote Evolver, the legendary Tresor and has also been label mate with Oscar on Semantica. Those with some knowledge of these labels will have some idea what to expect – but with this team up, they both bring their A-Game to the table.

Not to mention the formidable DJing skills of these guys, they’re literally decimating dancefloors and splitting unsuspecting listeners wide open across the globe, and on a regular basis – be sure to keep your eye out.

**Solid, industrial tinged soundscapes, heavy on the drums, underpinned by hypnotic mechanisms and brain-sparking tones, _Bare Hands_ kicks off the EP in fine style, with heavy delays on the aforementioned “hypnotic mechanisms”, pulling the listener in, enveloping them... All the while, those drums. Icy cool, essential business.**

The title track, _Sense of Purpose_ continues with the gnarly hypnotics, albeit with a little less aggression and a lot more space between the sounds. This is the kind of stuff that, while keeping the dancefloor packed, will cover the place in a shroud of silence from the revelers as they contemplate their existence, rhythmically. Wet, abrasive tones worm their ways in and out of the phat, insistent 808 beats and the ever-evolving hook that sounds like something emitted from the core of some event horizon. This is music direct from some super-massive black hole, lurking out there, at the edges of the cosmos.

**Next up, _Reformed Theology_ invokes visions of speeding alongside some super-fast radio bursts from the core of a far-off galaxy. Dirty, nasty riffs clash with white noise and fierce cymbal/hi-hat combos and infectiously abrasive acid-like riffs that will literally eviscerate the cerebrum of lesser mortals. Thunderous music, embedded in the darkest of matter.**

Last up on this veritable vortex of sonic exploration is _No Escape_, a tad more minimal in its approach and none the less powerful for it. A winding, twisted lead forms the basis for slightly more understated percussion and some wonky AF effects, wobbling to the max, forging the basis for this slab of hypnotic mindfuck - from which there is literally, no escape.

So, in sum; Blueprint have once again delivered a release that perfectly complements their tough, aggressively intelligent music for post-apocalyptic bunker dwellers. Second Skin are the perfectly progressive continuation of exactly what Blueprint have been working towards for their 20+ years in the business.

Enhorabuena muchachos, enhorabuena. (Did I say that correctly? Sorry – I only speak Portuguese on top of English)

This _essential_ release is due out in a couple of days on digital (around the 7th October I believe), vinyl lovers will have to wait until October 28th, however. We’ll keep you posted.
