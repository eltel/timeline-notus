**When you’ve been in the game as long as I have, the name Unique 3 stands for something beyond seminal, beyond innovative – Unique 3 quite literally defined their own genre, one that still holds true today. Many credit their specific genre with bringing about one of the first truly ‘British’ music styles, the Bleep & Bass style – otherwise known as UK Bass, a heady splicing of thunderous basslines, piercing bleeps, saw-toothed 303/acid riffs a smattering of (real) electro, overlain with heavy dub-reggae tones and, of course - techno. With 45 tracks released over the last 33 years this is an unmissable compilation of truly forward thinking, innovative musicality.**

As an old school raver, as someone who spun techno and all its related forms professionally for 20 + years, Unique 3 hold an incredibly special place, both in my heart and my record collection and I feel immensely privileged to be able to review something that was and continues to be such a major influence on my style.

From the fundamental, definitive moment of their first release, _The Theme_, which, quite literally, changed everything back in 1988 (oh those heady, halcyon days, what a time to have been alive), Unique 3 have distinctively forged their own, clear-cut, path through the musical labyrinth – taking their own, no-nonsense, non-compromising route – and this release is testament to that vision and purpose.

**There so many classics and genre (re)defining moments on this release it’s too much to cover adequately in just one review, so I'm going to do my best by focussing upon what I consider to be the highlights of a package of highlights (but that takes nothing away from the other cuts, there’s no filler content on here at all).**

An obvious stand out is the one and only _Rhythm Takes Control_ – the fact that something this deep and heavy, and absolutely, thoroughly and completely innovative could ever enter the top 40 charts in the UK was testament not only to the music but also to the times, we were so much more open minded as a country back then (could you imagine The Rude Boyz of House – House Nation entering the national top 10 today? I don’t think so). But that’s not to take anything away from the ingenuity of this track, the infectious lyrics and the maddest bass ever to appear on what essentially became a ‘pop’ record (via an extreme underground ethos) literally blew the nation away.

_Fury in the Force_ was another moment for me in my musical formation, cascading bass and bleeps and that pre-DnB drum workout interwoven with a techno mentality replete with dub-style wobbles literally removed the heads of many peeps on the floor whenever I spun this one out.

Showing masterful range and ability _Musical Melody_ (which they performed live on the UK’s Top of the Pops!) and _Reality_ hit hard with tough, raw and funky hip-hop vibes dripping with funk, and dub-reggae influences respectively – these are raw, funky/dubby and catchy as hell – **D.O.P.E.**

_Weight for the Bass_ was another cut that lived in my record box for maybe 10 years after its release – that mix of melodious keys and quirky, dark bass was catchy, beautiful and unnerving all at once. The bittersweet melancholy of _7 A.M_ spent equally as long in my box, trippy AF, infectious hooks and the perfect encapsulation of the vibe dancing in a field at 7am after a long night’s raving make this one a forever classic in my book.

One of the mightiest dubs in their repertoire is undoubtedly _Activity_, space bass, reverberating bleeps and trippy rolling percussion build up to what is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable hooks in dance music history – my god, I’m tearing up as I write this – the memories this evokes, the images it engenders in the mind’s eye – a veritable powerhouse of a track, with sentiment and drive.

**_Rude ‘Bout the Place_ is a classic bleep n bass affair from the 3, rolling beats – off-kilter bass hooks, as only Unique 3 can deliver, combine to deliver a short, but powerful message.**

There is such a wide, diverse range of styles on display here – as a DJ, I’ve focussed primarily on the cuts that have, and still do inspire me as a DJ – but, some of you may be unaware, Unique 3 also ventured into the UK hardcore territory, and there are plenty of house cuts, both vocal and otherwise – all testament to the range, ability and talent these guys have - and all the more reason for you to support this slice of history - which also provides glimpses into multiple parallel futures.

Support the vision and integrity of Unique 3 that undoubtedly formed the basis and inspiration for so many other artists and DJs – buy this release, in its entirety, and follow them on their journey, from start to the present, to innovate and drive the global music scene.

**Precious. Invaluable. Iconic.**
