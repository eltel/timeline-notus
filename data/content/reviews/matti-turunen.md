**Having released a number of records on London's Cultivated Electronics previously with musical partner Michael Diekmann as Morphology, Finland's Matti Turunen returns to the label in his own right with the "Radau" EP. This one, coming out on the label's vinyl-only series, Cultivated Electronics Ltd.**

**_Matti's previous solo ventures without his Morphology cohort are rare. The last time was a track for AC Records in 2013, with appearances also on Abstract Forms, Muhk and Bliq in previous years. This release features his signature electro-funk sound with four out-of-this-world quality tracks._**

Known for his love of emotional melodies, combining elements of techno, such as acid and vibrant drums to traditional electro in his work with Michael, this release continues the legacy of perfection.

**_"Aureum" and "Xhanthe" on the A side take us to the outer reaches of space, with haunting sci-fi pads, crisp, banging drums and deep basslines, while on the B side we descended the depths of the ocean on the title track, battling the deep and dark seas, and then resurfacing and being taken away on a serene wave that is "Memnonia"._**

After Morphology releases on Altered Sense and Firescope already this year, Matti's solo effort, coming out at the end of the month, shows that he is well and truly a master of his machines.

Highly recommended
