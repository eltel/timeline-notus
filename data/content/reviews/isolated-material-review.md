**The reinvigorated 20/20 imprint continues its quest to bring us the heat across the Electro spectrum and this release is once again of stellar quality. The artist arrives on the label after a slew of releases on other high-quality imprints, being French born but now residing in Berlin that is a creative hub and home to so many excellent artists and DJ’s pushing that pure sound of electro drenched in funk.**

**_To the music, ‘Abstraction layer’ is straight up droid funk, somewhere in the sphere of Stingray, Carl Finlow and Keith Tenniswood. The beats are fierce, and the groove is intense, vocodered vocal snippets just add to the overall feel of this. Dope._**

‘Asynchronous funk’ drops the tempo but neither the intensity nor the funk. A trip of a tune with layers of synthesised funk and fresh sounding beat programming.

Title track ‘Hidden node’ is more of the same but again the track has its own character. Complete with a sub-bass best appreciated on a system that you just know would growl. Got to say I cannot help but hear some of the more tech D’n’B influence on show here though I saw something online that mentioned Drexciya, so more like a fusion of influences, got Alix Perez in mind so the proper folks from two proper underground scenes.

Closing this release is ‘Unmarked sequence’ and that whole just well, underground electronic vibe is once again present. Listening to this through headphones is making me want to get my speakers setup promptly as is this proper dark funk.

**_So, there we have it, another high-class release on 20/20 that has always pushed the funk whatever style their releases have been. Ralph Lawson has really embraced the electro sound and as always has a timeless sense of quality control. And although it might just be my ears and experiences, this also have a genre bending feel to it, if you like the proper stuff you need to check. _**
