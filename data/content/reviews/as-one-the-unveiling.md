**Kirk Degiorgio. the man behind As One (along with Catherine Prendergast) is somewhat of a techno veteran, he has been delivering unique, funk-fueled, original and (mostly) melodious harmonics of the Detroit techno-flavoured variety since the late 90s, Often more down-tempo, at times powered by breaks as opposed to the 4-to-the-floor style techno, but always underpinned to some degree by profoundly moving warmth and heartfelt soul. This, in a nutshell, characterises the sound of As One**

_Here we have a 4 track EP on the one and only De:tuned, out relatively soon (watch this space!) featuring two brand new, original cuts and two remixes from the previous As One album._

‘The Unveiling’ is an aptly entitled track, as layers and layers of sonic beautification are added to the initial chord sequence something quite marvellous is indeed ‘unveiled’. The track progresses from shimmering soulful strings and pads, dipping its toes into more conventional techno territory momentarily from time to time as more divine composition is added to the mix, and once the ‘veil’ is finally lifted we’re left behind as better people. This is self-care, self-improvement in audio form. Nota dez! As we say here in Brazil (ten out of ten, basically).

The ‘Descent Module’, is written by Catherine Prendergast, the other half of As One, and is the second original cut on offer here, “warm melancholy” may seem a tad contradictory in terms but this is exactly what has been pulled off here. As pensive and as deep as they come this is quite the acid-tinged journey. Ever-evolving pads envelop the listener, like some aural security blanket. Replete with some ghostly riffs and some lovely, funky, off-kilter percussion, As One, proving once again, to be the go-to outfit for profoundly heartfelt music, where words/lyrics would just make no sense, the message is in the tones, the vibe, and the beats; and the message is “everything’s gonna be OK”.

Rounding off this slice of sublimity masquerading as an EP we have two top-notch remixes from As One’s ‘Communion’ LP (also on De:tuned). The first of them features the mighty Ian O’Brien on remix duties for ‘The Ladder’ - and I, for one, could not think of a better man for the job. Musically As One and Ian complement each other in too many ways to mention here. Sparkly lead synths and uplifting chords are driven by some amazingly jazzy drum work, bordering on breaks - this is some dope sh\*t and, again, that ever present sense of composition and progression (that defines these guys' work) as those heavenly keys transport the listener to a safe space, a comfort zone where life is generally better, in every aspect - musical escapism at its finest, exactly how it should be.

For the second of the aforementioned remixes, the one and only Luke Slater makes his first appearance on De:tuned, remixing ‘Absorption Spectra’ under his, somewhat awesome, 7th Plain moniker. Again, Luke’s work as 7th Plain complements the original artist's work perfectly, and this is clearly evident in this celestial, downtempo cut. This, quite literally, sounds like nothing I’ve ever heard before. This one, despite the ultra low-tempo, is super funky and danceable whilst also being brain fuel, as in it’s a heads-down, introspective, thought and emotion-engendering, sonic soul enhancement device. Phat crunchy, 4 x 4 drums, enhanced by crunchy break loops and overlain with some wondrous pads give this a cinematic feel; that - and an almost religious sentiment underlying the whole journey - make for an epic finish to an undoubtedly indispensable EP.

Out soon on super polished 180gr, coloured vinyl and of course on digital soon after, in all the usual outlets

**_Let’s do this one justice, people._**
