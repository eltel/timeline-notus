**Following on from InkiPak’s superb Confine EP on Magnonic Signals, label bosses Lee Wren Booth and Antonio Velazquez’s eighth offering on their label is a delectable slice of audio goodness from Bridport-based Jame Baker - AKA ReKab...**

**_If you like deep and emotional electronic music with soaring synth leads, reverb-drenched pads and pulsing baselines, then please give Jame’s ReKaB project some serious attention as there is real artistry and talent here._**

From the first listen to this EP you’re immediately immersed in a lush world of intelligent and uplifting electronics. Taking influences from spiritual jazz, funk and classic electronic music (think early Aphex, and Land cruising era Carl Craig), James creates four tracks that are uniquely ReKaB and absolutely wonderful.

Lovely melodies and harmonies, subtle arpeggios, and deep, minimal and funky baselines underpinned with clever percussion, give us 4 tracks of deep, funky and uplifting music that will work really well on any dance floor, if dropped at the right time. It’s not an “electro” banger but a happy and uplifting groover.

Production-wise, I love how James / ReKaB doesn’t clutter his tracks, showing surgical awareness of space and sonics, each element perfectly designed and layered to give it depth and emotion, with an attention to sound design that makes this EP really stand out. Having the tracks mastered by Morphology’s Michael Diekmann rounds out this release to make it, in my humble opinion, a “buy on sight” record.

**_There are zero fillers on this EP, but the standout track for me is Albear Wave which has been on repeat at Hierophant Towers…._**

Highly recommended.
