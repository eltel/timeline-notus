**The Chicago Bee creed is “dedicated to putting out vintage sounding acid and house on vinyl” and this release, Home Listening Acid and House, backs that up in spades.**

**_As Chicago Bee state on their Bandcamp page, “the vision for this compilation album was to create a collection of tracks that complement each other and are fitting for repeated home listening.” In addition to this, the double vinyl release is a somewhat conceptual experiment. The artists were asked to imagine fusing Acid and House with the Virtualsex LP”, released on Buzz back in 1993, and featuring tracks from techno masters such as Carl Craig, As One, and Stefan Robbers to name but a few. Being an old fart these days, and having heard that album many a time, and a fan of mid 90s techno, I can categorically say that this has been achieved with this release._**

Up first is Postelektrik with SW1, a blissful expedition, resplendent with euphoric pads and a perfect starting point for the music to follow. Sharing the A side is Derek Carr, taking a break from releasing on his own label, Trident Recordings, with a blissful house-tinged techno number. From the start with his signature full, haunting pads, this is Derek Carr continuing at the top of his game.

The B-side is full of downtempo, subtle, subdued 303 workouts on all three tracks, reminiscent of UR’s Nation 2 Nation, or World 2 World. Finland-based artist, Type 303, who recently put out the Acid Works ep on the label of the same name, starts with Stairway to Jupiter. Monofonix, who is probably better known under the Mantra name, is up next with Omega and finishing off the trifecta is Ivan Golac with Floated. Ivan is a cover name for an artist who wants to be kept anonymous.

Iron Blu, who has been producing and djing for 40-odd years, and co-runs the label Weapons of Desire, kicks off vinyl number 2 with Valtra. From the eerie pads, dark stabs and strings, this is a creeper of a track, perfect for kicking back in a darkened room with your headphones. A nice 303 toward the end complements the track perfectly. Glasgow’s Fear-E with Haven’t You Heard is up next and is my favourite track of the release. Another track that just ticks along nicely, with a cool 303 line, coupled with the pads that appear every now and then, this is just perfect. Side C ends with Cornwall-based duo, Forgotten Corner. Their track Maen Land would be the perfect soundtrack for moon exploration. Full of sci-fi bleeps and sounds, I envisage an astronaut, torch in hand, investigating a barren terrain.

Sheffield’s INFO kicks up the bpm on the d-side with Dreams of Andromeda. Again fitting the brief that the label asked for, this is very reminiscent of that 90s Detroit sound and will do great on the dancefloor. Rounding things off is A-Eno-Acid with Greek Town Casino, again perfecting that vintage techno sound.
