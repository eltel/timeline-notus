**Steve Rutter continues to carry the torch and keep the faith for emotive and soulful techno, with his seminal label Firescope Records. Having released a staggering 48 singles and albums (yeah, check Discogs), Firescope remains true to the spirit of intelligent techno; the artists continue to channel superb sonics and the artwork and vinyl innovations continue Steve’s B12 legacy.**

All of which brings us to John Shima’s 2nd album for Fiescope “Empty Lands”.

It’s been 3 years since John released his debut album The Lonely Machine and that was a lovely sonic journey.

3 years though feels like a long time ago, given that a fair few of us have had different and often hard journeys with lockdowns, covid, governments intent on doing the wrong thing and life events kicking us. However, into this landscape comes “Empty Lands”, developing the themes and motifs from the Lonely Machine and giving a deeper and more moving musical experience, tinged with melancholy but also hope.

I’ve listened to both albums on repeat a lot while writing this review, and it’s been a powerful and immersive experience. I can hear the classic early Detroit motifs in the pads and leads, the sound of Sheffield steel in the percussion and bass and the influences of early British electronica such as Likemind, B12 and Bleep, but this album does so much more than just riff on the classics; the composition, melodies and crucially counterpoint are pure John Shima.

The amount of work needed to create an album of this complexity can’t be underestimated and it’s really apparent when you really listen to it. There’s a reason why we’re not inundated with this type of music and that’s because it’s really complex to make!

**While it is an album of melodic techno, the constant beat underpinning the individual tracks makes sure that it steers away from being purely for the head and remains anchored in the dance floor. Having seen John play live you can see why he’s such a great performer and why his music absolutely comes to life in a sweaty club. Pounding rhythms and soulful and hypnotic melodies. Pure techno-soul.**

It’s hard to pick stand-out tracks from this album, but Sayaka has been one track that I keep coming back to. Lovely melodies, sparse, well-designed percussion, and space and depth in the mix that make this a real joy.
