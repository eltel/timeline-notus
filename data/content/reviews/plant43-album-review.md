**UK electro and deep techno connoisseurs will be lifted by the latest release from Plant43 [Emile Facey]. Releasing tracks since 2005, the impressive Plant43 discography is shared amongst the strongest of labels across the genre; Ai, Shipwrec, CPU, Semantica & AC Records amongst many more. Since 2020, the autonomy of Plant43 Recordings has delivered a sequence of top-drawer, and highly collectable machine souled 12"s and full LPs. Silver Streams is the 3rd album release, loosely falling into an ambient zone.**

This is a deeply atmospheric LP, released digitally already with a clear orange vinyl version available sometime in the near future….not all plants are working as efficiently as Emile! It is a refined collection of 8 diverse tracks, all touched by the characteristic style of Plant43 and yet comfortably bouncing & feeding off each other for a complete and engaging listen.

The ambient tag is less pertinent here as there are obvious time signatures, pacing and movement in many tracks, all diffusing out of the arps, synth-lines and barely-there percussion. Bass, drums and lower frequencies are largely imperceptible over the record, and whilst tracks titles look towards organic winter themes, the collection of tracks nurtures a warmth and gentle embrace.

Title track Silver Streams welcomes you, opening with a progressive and familiar sounding arp, towards it climax, atonal and extended high notes signify that this isn’t a typical Plant43 electro journey. Counting Imaginary Comets becomes effortless as its slower arp’s allure beyond the exosphere.

Progress in Paces is my standout track on the record. It keeps a languid tempo, using the most prominent hats of the LP over the subtlest of bass lines. It’s a treat to explore Emile’s deft touch with melody at this tempo, they firmly tug on the heart and soul. The darkest moment on the release is Deep In The Soil which is also the most drone-structured composition.

It skillfully avoids heavier menace before drifting back towards breathable air - I wonder whether this is another look towards mycology and buried networks?

**Inevitably this is a beautifully produced body of work and it's clearly evident after these not-stricly-ambient LPs, that Plant43 is composing far beyond the scope of an electro artist and I personally look forward to more of these adventures and potential collaborations. His live performances should also be witnessed to fully appreciate the craft.**
