**A new release on Sheffield’s CPU records is always a reason to stop, look and listen (if you remember your Green Cross Code) so getting a brand new slice of electronics from Martin Matiske, Aka Blackploid on CPU, gets my full and undivided attention.**

**_"Martin’s been releasing high-quality music as Blackploid since his debut Inhaltsverzeichnis EP. on Frustrated Funk in 2006, and he’s been releasing music since he was 15 starting with an EP on Dj Hell’s esteemed International Deejay Gigolo label in 2002 and subsequent records on Stilleben, LDAI, Femur and Moustache to mention a few."_**

Martin paused the Blackploid project in 2016 but came back in 2021 with two excellent releases for CPU and a belter for Alek Stark’s Electro Records the same year.

The Planetary Science EP (out on the 16th Sept) follows and develops the science fiction, and space travel themes of the previous CPU releases (Cosmic traveller and Strange Stars) and as with all Martin’s releases, expect high-quality electronics; but never anything formulaic. This is innovation, not repetition and the strength of this release speaks to CPU label boss Chris Smith’s constant and careful curation and Martin’s individuality and craft as a musician. These are absolutely future-facing tracks, with subtle elements of Italo and chiptune / 8bit that permeate in a great way.

My favourite track on the EP is Wires with its uncompromising funky vibe, persistent, evolving bassline, spring reverbed stabs and wonkiness. But, as you’d expect, there are no fillers on this record, each track is excellent and varied. For example I really like the structure of track 1, Dimension Unknown as it sounds like a mixture of different time signatures, but I think is actually really clever chord progressions and the end track Neurotransmitter has lovely pads with skittering percussive and science fiction elements closing out the record beautifully.

**_I hope there’ll be videos to go with these tracks at some stage as they are really cinematic and evocative. Finally, if you like this record (why would you not!) there’s an album due in 2023 and hopefully a chance to see Blackploid play live at some stage?._**

Highly recommended.
