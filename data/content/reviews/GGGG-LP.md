**Firescope has been a labour of love by label owner Steven Rutter, better known as one half of the legendary electronic duo B12. Always on the lookout for new music, each Firescope release is majestic in both the music and presentation. In what is the last vinyl release for the label, along with John Shima's "The Empty Lands", this record is no different. Stunning artwork by Catherine Siofra Prendergast, and resplendent in yellow vinyl, this album by the co-founder of D.Ko Records, Gabriel de Varine Bohan, also known as GGGG, is a perfect swansong for the vinyl versions of Firescope**

**_This album is quality from beginning to end. 12 tracks traversing ambient soundscapes, warm electronica and introspective techno, this is a beauty of a debut album by GGGG's. After an EP on Bardouin Music in 2021, and appearances on Fukuinn, Moving Rhythms and D.KO Records, the percussive_**

"K-Robot OG" gets things moving. From the subdued "Broutine Lam√©" and "Mudla 2.2", to the breakbeat-styled "Trip 2 Declinc", and the atmospheric tones on "Interlude" and "Cat Intro", this album has enough variety and beauty to listen from start to finish, and back again, for an otherworldly listening experience.

**_The melancholic beatless number "Sac Ala Blofel" is the perfect ending to a thoroughly blissful aural experience. Fans of B12, or more recently, Adelaide-based Featherstone will love this record._**

Head to the Firescope Bandcamp page to pre-order your vinyl, cd or digital version. Recommended!!

Highly recommended.
