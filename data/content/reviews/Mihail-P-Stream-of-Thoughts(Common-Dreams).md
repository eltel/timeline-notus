**Forthcoming on the Common Dreams label, Stream of Thoughts by the uber talented Mihail P.**

Common Dreams is a UK based label focused on the futuristic, funky, soulful side of electronic music. Prior to this, its eighth release, there are seven carefully curated slabs of electronic aural delight featuring artists such as Miles Atmospheric, Reedale Rise and Dan Piu.

Mihail P is an amazing producer, I have had the fortune to chat online with him before and can also vouch for the fact that he is a lovely human too. Mihail is on my list of producers where I just get everything they make. If you haven’t already – go check him out!

The A side starts with Relinquish. Atmospheric pads, synth stabs, deep electro break beat, and then a broken up and down bassline. As always Mihails attention to detail, precise and subtle percussion programming is sublime. The A2 is titled Shifting. Shifting is a four / four affair. Lovely chug tempo. A burrowing bassline, emotive pads build, a distant vocal shimmer sporadically. Again, layers of interwoven sounds, expertly pieced together without ever sounding too much or overwhelming.

**_Intelligent techno a mate of mine used to call it. Right on to the B side. Here is a remix of the title track by none other than John Shima – another of my favourite producers!_**
Shima starts his version with a four / four kick, backed up by looped up pads and keys and a stab, a slightly more joined up winding bassline than the original.

Builds and drops in all the right places, some beautiful, morphing synth lines. A solid interpretation of the original. Close to Zero round the release off, starting with evocative pads, then straight in with the electro break kick and percussion. This is transcendent, hypnotic, blissful, building, driving, intense, and subtle. My favourite track of the release. Incredible.

**Common Dreams continue on their path of top-notch quality control, Mr Shima never disappoints, and my man Mihail, well what can I say, he has delivered again. Outstanding.**.
