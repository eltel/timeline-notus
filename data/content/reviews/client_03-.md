**Cultivated Electronics present their latest release, and it is a corker. Four tracks of the proper kind, cruising the multiverse via a dancefloor. I was intrigued to see a collaboration on one of the tracks with label boss, Sync 24. I am more accustomed to his weapons-grade remixes so this should be a real treat.!**

**_I must admit the artist is new to me but from checking the music out it is possible we went to the same school, so to speak! But then that is what labels like CE do so well in providing a place for the good stuff._**

First up is title track ‘Sense combiner’ which is proper alien funk, full of relentless dancefloor energy. Simple, effective and deadly.

‘Morality_Corruption_Splice_Pointer’ is more of the same uptempo outer space funk manoeuvres. The emphasis being placed firmly on the groove and your ability to get fully lost in it.

As I said we could have gone to the same school of sorts and this is further proof of that statement. Bass-heavy, funk-filled, weapons-grade electronics.
Next up is the collaboration with label boss, Sync 24. ‘Counterfactual Interaction History’ slows the tempo down but there is no cessation of the funk. A slightly more acidic groove is present and the rhythm is still incessant and heavy.

Closing out the release is ‘You Have Been Notified’ which is further proper tackle. Mutant funk of the highest order. The whole groove just ebbs and flows with it’s relentlessness. Once again a forward-looking track of proper funky electronics.

**_As always the quality control of CE is first class, if you are after some of the proper good stuff, schooled in the D sound but full of its own character then this is definitely for you._**

Highly Recommended.
