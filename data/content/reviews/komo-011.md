**An intriguing blend of influences are clearly visible on this release. A European producer heavily influenced by the sound of Detroit but also some choice other people, such as Laurent Garnier and his F Comm imprint. The press release perfectly encapsulates what you are about to hear. Three cuts of the real, pure funk.**

**_Title track ‘Orbit’ opens things and is proper. Properly driving funk, complete with those emotive kind of strings that only come from Detroit. But yes, I do hear lots on influences. Choice._**

‘Birds flying high’ is a more laid-back affair, still with a feel of that driving funk but less intense. Again, those influences are present, and the result is quite unique.

‘Black analysis master’ is more expertly and deftly delivered electronic joy. We are definitely in that special place of Hi-tek jazz. Proper and then some.

**_‘You need to check this as I had no choice but to get to the point as it hits the spot!! _**

Three cuts of fresh, forward electronic funk. What’s not to love, just buy it folks.
