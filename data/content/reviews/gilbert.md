**It's hard to believe that this is only Gilbert's second full release, such is the quality throughout each track. After a number of appearances on V/A records on labels such as Innate and We're Going Deep, the Bristol-based producer's debut EP on Echocentric was one of my favourite records of 2021.**

**_"Shift the Focus" is out now on the Dutch label 030303 and sounds like the long-lost child of Orbital's "In-sides" and Larry Heard's, "Alien"_**

I imagine this record as being the soundtrack to a journey through space, searching for distant life. "Ylem" kicks things off with a burst, its brooding pads and strong kick getting us out of the solar system. Up next is "Lucid Dream", and as we pass through the Oort Cloud, this track sets the scene for a more hopeful and serene journey on the flip.

"Shift the focus" does just that, with its lovely pads, sound bursts are sent out to a distant planet, anticipating a reply. This is received with the subtle 303 toward the second half of the track. Picking up on this, our mission starts to descend on the planet, with Gilbert asking the questions on the final track, by way of the haunting strings, "Are We Alone?", yearning for an answer. And again, we get it with a perfect baseline, letting us know, that we are definitely not alone. With music this cosmic and otherworldly, one could ask the question, "Is Gilbert one of us?".

**_Don't sleep on this release. Equally at home in a discerning DJ's set or something to kick back and listen to on the headphones, "Shift the Focus" is another winner from Gilbert. I'm looking forward to more!_**

Highly recommended. OUT NOW In All Good Record Shops
