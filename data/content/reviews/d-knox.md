**Despite having released music for two decades, Donnell Knox, aka D-Knox, is one of techno's unsung heroes. Hailing from Kalamazoo, halfway between Detroit and Chicago, you can instantly hear the influences of both house and techno in his music. In addition to running the Sonic Mind imprint, which started back in 1995 and is now over 30 releases deep, D-Knox has also appeared on labels such as Black Nation, Elypsia and EPM to name but a few.**

**_The latest release, 'The Body of Christ EP', dropping today, was originally released in 1997 as the first 12" on Magic Trax, the label created to coincide with the influential Magic Feet fanzine._**

There's not really too much to say about this release, it's a magnificent techno workout. 4 tunes of in-your-face techno, with banging kicks, insistent percussion, fusing pianos, spacey textures, these tracks succeed in appealing to the head as well as the feet. If you like your mid-90s techno in the vein of Jeff Mills and Rob Hood, this is the record for you. Do yourself a favour and check out D-Knox's back catalogue while you're at it. There's enough techno and house to enjoy!.

**_A few rare copies of the original 12" will be resurfacing, alongside a digital release via Donnell's own Sonic Mind label on September 26, which marks the first time that these tracks will be available for downloading and streaming._**

Highly recommended.
