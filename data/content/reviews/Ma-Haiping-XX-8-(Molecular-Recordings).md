**Molecular recordings have been active on the techno scene since the late ‘90s, consistently delivering minimal, sparsely arranged, and thought-provoking dancefloor decimators. Having featured such talents as Inigo Kennedy, Jeroen Search, Michael Burkat, Anderson Noise, Lars Klein, Oliver Ho, Claude Young Adam Beyer and, of course, label owner himself, Marco Lenzi, Molecular have built up a formidable roster of releases over the decades and this one only adds to the legend that comprises the trajectory of Molecular.**

Having previously released on Jeff Mills’ prestigious, genre defining Axis Records (Ma’s last release in fact), Ma Haiping enters the fray on Molecular having already brought about high levels of expectation. Let us just say, he meets those expectations admirably, and then some!

The somewhat generically entitled “XX 8 A” seems to maybe reference some kind of formula, or mathematic equation to be solved, and maybe that is what occurs in the heads of those who are in the process of losing it on the dancefloor to this beast, because that’s exactly what this is – a beast of a track. One with plenty going on, driving and pulsating along, laden with killer touches and mind warping flourishes. Hints of industrial techno merge with that familiar, spaced-out Axis records sound to provide a powerful number for the dancefloor crowd with more than enough cerebral aesthetics to engage the more pensive, trainspotter crowd. Loved it.

**“XX 8 AA” is more hypnotic, insistent even, as events build to form a swirling emotive collage of extraneous sonic weaponry, cultivated lovingly into a coherent journey through places unknown – destination irrelevant, this is all about the journey.**

This is confidently awesome sci-fi tech, this sound will only ever evolve, grow, and mutate, changing form. This cannot, by definition, get old, innovation is inherent not just in the sounds used, but in in the layered composition used to carve out this trans-stellar, multi-paradigmatic pathway.

**Thoroughly recommended!!**

### This one is out later this week (Sept 16th).
