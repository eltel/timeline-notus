**Bristol's We're Going Deep serves up another slice of delectable electronics from stalwart Dircsen.**

**_Given how well-established Bristol based label We're Going Deep is, it’s hard to believe that it’s only been 2 years since this imprint started. But there it is 12 solid releases in 2 years and the label continues to go from strength to strength. Hardly a surprise when you consider label boss Paul Wise’s credentials - resident DJ at I Love Acid and Genosys, acid house stalwart and founder of the We're Going Deep Facebook group, which is an essential repository of all things deep and a great place to go to discover new gems and get fascinating snippets of electronic music history._**

We're Going Deep #12 is number 4 in the recent series of solo artist releases, the other 8 releases on this label are all VAs. This release is a sure-fire classic from Dircsen who has been quietly getting on with the task in hand and releasing deep groovers since 2005, refreshingly without the hype and hyperbole that seems to accompany so many releases now.

As with all things We're Going Deep, expect quality on this EP. Dircsen serves up 4 tracks covering a range of style from dub techno, acid, deep techno, and spaced-out deep house. These are all strong groovers designed for the dance floor and lovely long mixes, not peak-time bangers but essential music for heads and feet. In fact, I’d suggest that if you’re after bangers this may not be your EP, but if you want an EP that you’ll still be playing in 10 years’ time this might be it. To me it could be a set staple and secret weapon, in fact listening to this EP, I was reminded of Mike Grant’s excellent Moods & Grooves imprint which also served up a range of deep house and techno for discerning heads.

Notable highlights for me on the EP are the opening track - Nothing Remains and B1 - Nervous Disorder. Nothing Remains is a shimmering, dub techno odyssey, with subtle pads enhancing a driving beat, shifting, and echoing percussion and a lovely and insistent driving bassline. minimal (but not MNML) and crucially not formulaic, as can be the case with so much music in this style.

My favourite track on the whole EP though is Nervous Disorder. I absolutely love tracks like this, phased 303s creating a spacey atmosphere perfect for shifting a club onto the next level of an evening and ratcheting up the tension and vibe.

**_Coupled with excellent mastering by Johan Westerman this is another sure-fire winner._**

Nice one.

Highly Recommended.
