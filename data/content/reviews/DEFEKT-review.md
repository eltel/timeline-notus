**Cultivated Electronics unleash a new series of 12”s that are aimed at, with laser-guided precision, the world’s most discerning dance floors. Given the existing CE roster and new artists that are releasing on this CE LTD sub-label, expect very good things indeed from stalwart Phil (Sync 24) Bolland**

Vol 1 of this imprint sets out the intention loud and clear, with wicked tracks from DeFeKT and Rico Casazza who take a side of the record each and, in no uncertain way, bring the heat.

Matthew Flanagan, AKA DefeKT does what he does best and serves up 2 expertly crafted, no-nonsense, peak-time slammers that are guaranteed to ramp the energy up more than a notch when they’re dropped. The opening track “Control Your Mind” is excellent; industrial and distorted drums and baselines, vocal samples, off-kilter pads and a frenzy of percussion that then goes properly bonkers mid-way through and will have heads bouncing in those dark rooms.

The second DefeKT track “Fear and Body” is also no slouch in the heavy-hitting department. Jacking beats, distorted vocals, arpeggiated and well-wonky baselines and science fiction pads; I can’t wait to play this out!

The B side of this release has two tracks from London-based Federico Casazza AKA Rico Casazza. Federico has been consistently releasing a wide range of deep electronic music, that includes tech and deep house, minimal, techno and more recently electro and acid, since 2008 and this is his second outing on CE (CE026).

On this split ep Rico gives us 2 solid tracks here that are less intense than the DefeKT offerings, but more than adequately equipped to do the business. “Here Home Us” is a deep and mellow affair with a nicely restrained acid line and “Caldo” is a solid and driving track replete with metallic sounds and insistent basslines that slowly build, but never reach a peak -ideal in the mix.

#### Overall, a great EP and I can’t’ wait to hear what comes next.
