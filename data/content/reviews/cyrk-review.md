**Long-time favourites at Hierophant towers, Berlin-based Cyrk (Samy Goossens and Pascal Hetzel) continue their relentless sonic assault, with a new ep on Phil Bolland’s esteemed Cultivated Electronics.**

Attack Of The Blow Up Dolls is a no-nonsense EP, destined to make dance floors hot, sweaty, and sticky; with the energy of Cyrk’s productions and the enhanced sonics that all releases on CE seem to have.

In the 7 years that they’ve been making music as Cyrk, Sammy and Pascal have produced 2 albums and 13 singles, releasing on their own label, Rawax, Burial Soil, Avoidant, Science Cult, Lone Romantic, Childhood and now Cultivated. I’m a massive fan of their music which can range from brutal electro, italo disco, acid, techno and obviously 2021’s amazing Hidden Geometries track which was also remixed by UK luminaries Plaid.

Each of the four tracks on this EP is a non-nonsense workout, standouts for me are the title track Attack of The Blow-Up Dolls, which is a jacking, pumping, pile driving machine. complete with Insistent stabs, eerie background noises, arps, driven by a punchy as hell relentless percussion.

**The second track, Tsikey takes more of a spacey and dark trippy vibe, but still has that requisite rhythm, nasty baselines and an amazing double tracked (maybe?) lead which is both eerie and uplifting at the same time. well suited for the 5 in the morning weirdness.**

Nice EP & looking forward to getting the wax.
