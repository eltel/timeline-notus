## Oh yeah...

**The press release for the latest offerings from Detroit’s Filthiest states “A track so funky, not even the god of monsters can tame it.**

Julian Shamou’s long-running Motor City Electro Company (MCEC) serves up the slickest and sickest slice of electro-funk I’ve had the pleasure of hearing for a long time, courtesy of his Detroit’s Filthiest project. No clichéd arps and pro-one workout here, this is one funky-arsed piece of soulful music. Lovely chord stabs, funky baselines and a bouncing lead that oozes classic jazz-fusion, a la Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters.

**The only negative I can think of is that it’s a one-tracker, but when that one track is this good, IMHO this is worth the £s. Digital release only at this stage, but hopefully it’ll get pressed on wax at some stage, possibly as another collaboration with Casa Voyager, as with some other gems from MCEC’s back catalogue.**

Smooth.....
