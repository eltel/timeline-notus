Stasis Recordings Presents - In Stasis

## First Sunday Of Each Month, 8pm - 10pm GMT

"In Stasis is an extension of the Stasis Recordings ecosystem. The show highlights our label catalog, releases by our roster elsewhere, and any production connections we have; works on the premise of "six degrees of separation". Sonic wise we run the gauntlet of electronic music from ambient to downtempo, strains of techno to all manner of house, dub to forms of d&b, with pit stops in other genres just so no one is left out."
