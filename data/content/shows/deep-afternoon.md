## Every last Saturday Of The Month, 12pm - 2pm

**Deep afternoon proposes to be nothing else but the raw concept of our love for good music, showcased through various dj mixes born out of carefully selected records and tracks.**

Barely going over 119 bpm, this show is about getting you ready for the warm-up weekend or jump-starting your Saturday afternoon.

**Deep Afternoon will be hosted by Vivian Ababi and Alex Buliga.**
