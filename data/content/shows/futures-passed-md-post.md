**Futures Passed is a show designed to document sonic visions of the future, from days gone by. This will be taking place via the Timeline Music platform on a sporadic basis. We'll be going through the B sides from the early 80s and 90s crates and beyond. Digging out music from the likes of Stasis, Gemini, U.R, Mike Dunn and forgotten classics from Chicago and Detroit and, of course, not forgetting the UK, Europe and Asia, as we all agree - this is a global thing - _RIGHT_?**
