Leah Floyeurs – Leah with Sound

## Last Wednesday Bi Monthly, 8pm-10pm

"Leah with Sound was the first show on Timeline Music when it launched in May 2012 and since then Leah has played many festivals and clubs around the country and abroad. Although heavily influenced by the 90s Detroit sound, her shows cover a wide range of electronic music, from ambient sounds through to harder techno, electro and deep house. No frills, no pills, just skills and Mills."
