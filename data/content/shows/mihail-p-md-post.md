Mihail P – Multiverse Sessions

## 3rd Tuesday of every month 8pm - 9:30pm

"The Multiverse Sessions is about looking within to find a real personal connection to the music. Highlighting my own inspirations and aspirations for my productions. With this in mind, these sessions will be free of genre limitation, more influenced by sound palettes, textures and 'feel'. Some parts of the show will be mixed and some tracks will be left to play in their entirety so join me and lets float through space together"
