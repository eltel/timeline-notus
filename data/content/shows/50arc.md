50arc is a loose collection of techno travellers, gathering a few times a year in out-of-the-way-venues across London to receive celestial electronic messages.

Join Helen & Charlie as they channel the 50arc dancefloor, featuring occasional guests from the party, on their bi-monthly show, live on Timeline Music."
