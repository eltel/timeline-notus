# Luke Magner presents - Flux

## First Friday Of The Month, 8pm-10pm

"Luke has grown up with a variety of music from a very early age, Blondie, Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk were key artists from the age of 5, growing up then discovered disco, early breakdance and electro.
The Rave scene took off through his teenage years, when he first started collecting records, then scraped enough money together to buy belt drive decks and a cheap mixer, hooked on blending many different styles and genres addiction to discovering new music was in full flow.

Luke was a DJ at many underground parties in Cardiff, through his university years in the late 90s.
The passion kept growing, always discovering new sounds, genres and connections between the past and present.
My show Flux shows my drive to explore connections between different styles of music from deep house, dub, techno, disco and electro."
