Co-Owner of Gated Recordings, Node, opens up the gates for 2 hours of Electronic music meddling.

As a label, Gated continues to put out a consistent dose of high grade music, often in the form of Acid, Electro, Techy influenced Bass, Breakbeats and beyond.

With their label podcast, also presented by Node, they've been promoting their own releases while also digging deep to bring a mint selection of guest DJ's, including many who have produced for the label.

Here, for the Unlocked series on Timeline Music, Node will crack his knuckles and endeavour to broadcast from the remote Japanese isle he resides on. Expect a selection of quality, non-genre locked, electronics, including Gated exclusives and past classics.
